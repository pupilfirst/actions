          We're sorry, but we couldn't read a valid GitHub URL in your
          submission. When making another submission, please ensure that you
          submit a GitHub URL that looks like this:

          ```
          https://github.com/USERNAME/REPONAME
          ```

          We're sorry, but we were unable to clone a git repository using the
          URL that you supplied in your submission. For the record, this was
          the URL we tried to clone a repository from:

          ```
          https://github.com/${{ steps.get-repo-name.outputs.result }}
          ```

          This usually happens if the supplied URL is incorrect, or the
          repository is private.

          Before making another submission, please ensure that the submitted
          repository is visible to the public.

          It looks like your repository doesn't contain some files or folders
          that this assignment requires. Please check the following list of
          paths and ensure that they're present in your repository:
